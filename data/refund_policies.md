## SkyLink Airlines: Comprehensive Refund and Cancellation Policy

At SkyLink Airlines, we understand that travel plans can change unexpectedly. Our policies are designed to offer flexibility while ensuring fair practices for all our passengers. Please review the following detailed guidelines regarding refunds, cancellations, and changes to your booking.

---

### 1. General Principles

*   **Fare Rules Apply:** All tickets are subject to specific fare rules at the time of purchase, which dictate their refundability, changeability, and associated fees. These rules are displayed during the booking process and on your e-ticket confirmation.
*   **Original Form of Payment:** Refunds, when applicable, will generally be processed back to the original form of payment used for the purchase.
*   **Non-Transferable:** Tickets are generally non-transferable to another person.
*   **24-Hour Risk-Free Cancellation:** For tickets purchased directly from SkyLink Airlines at least 7 days prior to departure, you may cancel for a full refund within 24 hours of purchase, regardless of the ticket type.

### 2. Ticket Types & Refundability

The refundability of your ticket largely depends on the fare class purchased:

*   **Non-Refundable Tickets (Economy Saver, Economy Standard, Premium Economy Flex):**
    *   **General Rule:** These tickets are not eligible for a cash refund to the original form of payment, except under the 24-hour risk-free cancellation rule or in specific airline-initiated circumstances (see Section 5).
    *   **Future Travel Credit:** If you cancel a non-refundable ticket, the value of the ticket (minus any applicable cancellation fees) may be retained as a future travel credit (eCredit/voucher) for use on a subsequent SkyLink Airlines flight. This credit is typically valid for 12 months from the original date of purchase.
    *   **Basic Economy:** Our most restrictive fare. Basic Economy tickets are generally **not eligible for changes or cancellations** for future credit, even with a fee, unless specifically stated otherwise or under the 24-hour rule.

*   **Refundable Tickets (Economy Flexible, Business Class, First Class):**
    *   **General Rule:** These tickets are eligible for a full refund to the original form of payment if canceled prior to the scheduled departure time. No cancellation fees apply.
    *   **Higher Cost:** Refundable tickets are typically priced higher than non-refundable options due to their flexibility.

### 3. Cancellation Policy (By Passenger)

**A. Non-Refundable Tickets:**

*   **Cancellation Prior to Departure:**
    *   If you cancel your non-refundable ticket *before* the scheduled departure of the first flight segment, the value of the ticket (minus a cancellation fee) will be issued as a SkyLink Airlines eCredit/voucher.
    *   **Cancellation Fees:** Fees vary by route and fare class, typically ranging from $99 - $250 USD for domestic flights and $200 - $400 USD for international flights. Specific fees will be clearly stated at the time of cancellation.
    *   **eCredit Usage:** The eCredit can be used for future travel on SkyLink Airlines for the passenger named on the original ticket. It must be redeemed and travel completed within 12 months from the original ticket purchase date.
*   **No-Show Policy:**
    *   If you fail to cancel your ticket *before* the scheduled departure time and do not show up for your flight ("no-show"), the entire value of the ticket will be forfeited, and no future travel credit will be issued.
    *   Subsequent segments of the same itinerary will also be automatically canceled without refund or credit.

**B. Refundable Tickets:**

*   **Cancellation Prior to Departure:**
    *   You are eligible for a full refund to your original form of payment, provided the cancellation is made *before* the scheduled departure of the first flight segment. No cancellation fees apply.
*   **No-Show Policy:**
    *   If you fail to cancel your ticket *before* the scheduled departure time and do not show up for your flight, the ticket value may be forfeited. We strongly advise cancelling even refundable tickets if you do not plan to travel.

### 4. Change Policy (By Passenger)

**A. Non-Refundable Tickets:**

*   **Changes Prior to Departure:**
    *   Changes to flight date, time, or destination are permitted for a fee, plus any difference in fare.
    *   **Change Fees:** Fees vary by route and fare class, typically ranging from $75 - $200 USD for domestic flights and $150 - $350 USD for international flights. Basic Economy tickets are generally not changeable.
    *   **Fare Difference:** If the new flight is more expensive than the original ticket, you must pay the difference in fare. If the new flight is cheaper, no refund will be issued for the difference on non-refundable tickets; the original value is maintained.
*   **Name Changes:** Name changes are generally not permitted. Minor corrections (e.g., spelling errors, maiden to married name with documentation) may be allowed for a nominal fee or free of charge, subject to airline discretion.
*   **Same-Day Confirmed Changes:** For a fee (typically $75 USD), passengers may request a confirmed change to an earlier or later flight on the same day, on the same route, provided seats are available in the same fare class. This option is often available within 24 hours of the desired flight.

**B. Refundable Tickets:**

*   **Changes Prior to Departure:**
    *   Changes to flight date, time, or destination are permitted without a change fee.
    *   **Fare Difference:** You will only pay or be refunded the difference in fare between the original and new ticket.
*   **Name Changes:** Generally not permitted, similar to non-refundable tickets.

### 5. Special Circumstances & Waivers

In certain unforeseen circumstances, SkyLink Airlines may offer waivers to our standard cancellation and change fees:

*   **Airline-Initiated Schedule Changes/Cancellations:**
    *   If SkyLink Airlines cancels your flight or makes a significant schedule change (typically defined as a change of 3+ hours, but can vary), you are entitled to:
        *   Rebooking on the next available SkyLink Airlines flight to your destination at no additional cost.
        *   Rebooking on an alternative airline (at SkyLink's discretion) if our options are not suitable.
        *   A full refund to your original form of payment, even for non-refundable tickets, if you choose not to accept the alternative travel arrangements.
*   **Medical Emergencies/Bereavement:**
    *   In cases of serious illness/injury to the passenger or immediate family member, or the death of an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent), SkyLink Airlines may waive change/cancellation fees or offer a refund/credit upon review of official documentation (e.g., doctor's note, death certificate).
*   **Government/Military Orders:**
    *   Active duty military personnel and their dependents may be eligible for waivers on change fees due to official orders (e.g., deployment, reassignment). Documentation required.
*   **Natural Disasters/Severe Weather:**
    *   When severe weather or natural disasters impact airport operations, SkyLink Airlines may issue a travel waiver allowing passengers to change their flight without fee or receive a refund. These waivers are typically announced proactively on our website for affected dates and routes.
*   **Visa/Entry Denials:**
    *   If a passenger is denied entry or visa for their destination, refunds or waivers are generally not granted unless the denial occurred due to an airline error or specific government advisories *after* ticket purchase. We recommend securing all necessary travel documents before booking.
*   **Death of Passenger:**
    *   In the unfortunate event of the passenger's death, a full refund will be issued to the estate upon presentation of a death certificate.

### 6. Travel Insurance Recommendations

SkyLink Airlines strongly recommends purchasing comprehensive travel insurance, especially for non-refundable tickets and international travel. Travel insurance can provide coverage for:

*   **Trip Cancellation/Interruption:** Financial protection if you need to cancel or cut short your trip due to unforeseen events (e.g., illness, family emergency, job loss).
*   **Medical Emergencies:** Coverage for medical expenses incurred during your trip.
*   **Baggage Loss/Delay:** Reimbursement for lost, stolen, or delayed luggage.
*   **Flight Delays:** Coverage for expenses incurred due to significant flight delays.

Please note that travel insurance is a third-party product and separate from SkyLink Airlines' policies. Review the terms and conditions of any insurance policy carefully.
